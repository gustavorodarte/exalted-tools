This Charm has two uses. The one mote version enhances an Archery attack, preventing any peripheral motes spent on the attack from adding to the character’s anima banner. In addition, if the attack does health levels of damage to the target, that target’s anima display rises by a number of motes commensurate to the peripheral motes spent on the attack. Because the Solar is shooting out her own anima, this Charm expressly allows her to tag non-Exalted opponents with anima displays.

Activating this Charm, the Solar becomes impossible to target for all opponents outside of his engagement range.

For example, if rejecting a supernaturally persuasive offer would normally require two Willpower, the Exalt can spend two Willpower; four motes, one Willpower; or 8 motes. If the character would normally break free of the mental influence after spending a certain amount of Willpower, treat the character as having paid the full Willpower price even if it is paid in motes."

This Charm is a counterattack that may be used in response to any unnatural mental influence directed at the Solar. The Solar’s caste mark blazes white and red for a moment; then, wherever the attacker may be, she is engulfed in a bonfire of pure white flames. This is treated as an automatically successful Shaping counterattack which inflicts (Essence) dice of lethal damage (aggravated against creatures of darkness) soakable only with charms and similar powers. Should any astrology be used to attempt to divine the target’s fate during the scene in which Sacrosanct Soul Retribution is directed at him, such inquiries automatically succeed, but return only the following puzzling message: THE SOLAR IS HERE.This Charm may be used regardless of the range from which unnatural mental influence is deployed, but may only be used once in response to a particular static source of mental influence. For example, the Solar could only deploy this Charm in response to a book enhanced with Linguistics Charms once, no matter how many times he read the book.At Integrity 6+, Essence 6+, the Solar may also pay one point of Willpower to bestow the creature of darkness mutation on targets of this Charm, as a Shaping effect.

This Charm’s activation requires at least one hour of personal interaction, which may take a wide variety of forms. Patiently listening to a subject while they explain what ails them, sitting together to watch the sun rise or set, or an evening of lovemaking would all qualify. This Charm has two effects. First, the Solar may target and remove one derangement from the target’s mind, regardless of whether it was inflicted by Charms, sorcery, the Wyld, or the simple stresses of life (if any effect contests this, the Solar adds his Presence in automatic successes to the roll-off). Second, the Solar forges in the target an Intimacy to a specific memory in the target’s life of which she is aware. So long as this Intimacy endures, the target may not reacquire the derangement the Solar cured, nor may that memory be in any way tampered with, altered, poisoned, removed, or corrupted."

The Solar may make (Wits + Investigation) rolls to detect impending threats to any person or location he has an Intimacy toward, even those posed by individuals he has not profiled. The difficulty of this roll is always 5. This warning manifests itself one week before the danger actualizes itself. For example: “The mercantile district of Hollow will be destroyed by a magically-triggered earthquake” or “My Lunar mate will be slain by another Exalt.” Spending one Willpower when the roll is made grants the Solar a flash of intuitive insight gleaned through context clues in his surroundings— the Storyteller informs the Solar’s player of a place where he might profitably begin investigating the impending disaster."

The player picks two. Storytellers can invent more powers for the three Absorptions, if they like. If this benefit seems too powerful for a series, Storytellers can restrict characters to one power per Absorption, or raise the Essence prerequisite to 6.Devonian: A Devonian master must believe in the repeatable, calculable nature of Essence and the power of careful observation, logic and experiment. She also must conduct extensive experiments in natural and supernatural science, adding a further minimum of Lore 3.• Manse and artifact attunements are repeatable experiments. With a successful (Intelligence + Lore) roll, difficulty ([Manse or Artifact rating] x 2), the sorcerer can attune to such a thing in 20 ticks instead of the usual 20 minutes or so. If she ever succeeds on the roll for a given object, thereafter she always succeeds again.• When a Devonian master analyzes a supernatural effect, her player’s (Intelligence + Occult) roll becomes extended. Each roll represents a week of research and experiment. Given time, she can probably puzzle out any supernatural effect. A single botched roll means the analysis ends in failure — even the Absorption cannot solve every puzzle of Essence—and Excellences do not apply. The gradual, systematic analysis rules out the flashes of supernatural genius the Excellences represent.• Deep study of each spell helps a Devonian master cast spells despite interruptions. When the character’s Shape Sorcery action is disrupted, she may reflexively apply any Occult Excellency she knows to the (Wits + Occult) roll to carry on with spellcasting.Salinan: A Salinan master demonstrates belief that everyone is an individual thought in a universal consciousness, and that all Essence flows most freely in its natural state. Such characters can see meaning and connections in the most surprising things. A Salinan master requires at least Awareness 3 to represent her sensitivity to Creation.• Understanding that herself is simultaneously hers alone and part of Creation’s own nonlocal consciousness, the Salinan master can use Emerald Countermagic against any unnatural mental influence, as long as it is backed by an Essence or Artifact rating no higher than half her own (round up). Using Sapphire Countermagic can counter effects of (Essence/2) + 1. Using Adamant Countermagic can counter effects of up to her full Essence.• A Salinan master can pull information from nowhere (or maybe from the Salinan Working). Whenever his player rolls a threshold of five successes on any Perception or Intelligence roll, the Storyteller imparts a piece of relevant, important information.• Everything is connected to everything else. A Salinan master can apply Creation’s wholeness to arcane links. She can substitute one arcane link for any other to the same subject, no matter what a spell’s description says. (She could use a lock of a victim’s hair, for instance, rather than the required drop of his blood.) What’s more, with three different arcane links to a person or place, she can use them to target any spell.Silurian: A Silurian master believes Creation is an arbitrary system of interacting symbols that he can manipulate through its syntax. These sorcerers tend to see everything in terms of symbols and communication: map and territory, call and response, rhetoric and games. Their Absorption requires Linguistics 3 or better.• A Silurian master can block the powers of the Fair Folk, who likewise treat Creation as a fiction they change at will. A Silurian master can use Emerald Countermagic against any Fair Folk Charm or glamour backed by Essence no higher than her own (round up).• Silurian masters excel at recombining the symbolic components of spells. The character can invent new versions of spells he knows, changing one aspect of its manifestation such as the shape of its area, its manifested substance or its elemental source — but the Essence cost stays the same and the new version cannot offer any net advantage. (For instance, Death of Silver Butterflies offers financial advantage, but doesn’t make the spell more effective as a spell.) The variation costs the character half the experience of learning a truly new spell. Characters who don’t already know the original spell or lack Silurian training pay full cost for the variant spell.• A Silurian master can break symbolic connections to herself. If her player succeeds at a reflexive (Wits + Essence) roll, with a difficulty of the attacking sorcerer’s Essence, the character breaks the arcane link before the spell can affect her.THE TIME IS NOWLords of CreationCost: — (+10m, 1wp); Mins: Occult 6, Essence 6; Type: Permanent; Keywords: Native, Obvious; Duration: Permanent; ",

Spirits normally dissipate rather than dying when they lose all of their health levels to damage. The Solar invokes this Charm after making a successful attack that damages or dissipates a spirit. In addition to the normal damage from this attack, this Charm transfers a number of motes from the spirit to the Solar equal to (the Solar’s permanent Essence x 2). If the spirit loses its last health level to this attack and dissipates, this Charm consumes the spirit utterly. Its Essence dissolves, and it will never be remade."

Magic-Shattering Strike permits the Solar’s attack to disrupt sorcery, necromancy, and Sorcerous-keyword Charms. The Lawgiver targets a spell or appropriate Charm and spends fifteen motes. The Charm or spell must be Obvious to the Lawgiver’s senses to be a valid target for Magic- Shattering Strike. If the attack (which may use any combat Ability) successfully strikes the beneficiary of the spell, then the spell is broken as though targeted by the weakest level of countermagic capable of affecting it. If the spell creates or summons an automaton or spirit, the Lawgiver’s attack must target that automaton or spirit. If the spell is a free-standing effect, such as Rain of Doom, then the attack must be generally aimed at the center of the spell’s area of effect, and the effect is considered to have a Parry DV of (Circle x 3) for spells, or (Minimum Essence + 2) for Sorcerous Charms. Should the Solar successfully shatter a spell or Charm in this fashion, he gains (Spell’s Circle x 4) or (Charm’s Minimum Essence + 2) motes for doing so. Magic-Shattering Strike may explicitly be placed in a Combo with Charms of other Abilities."

While this Charm remains in effect, sunlight itself becomes the eyes of the Solar… and the target knows it. Wherever she should go, she feels the Solar’s gaze upon her in the light of the sun. As a result, the target feels constantly watched and followed — even indoors, she can feel the baleful sun dogging her every step. As a result, all Awareness rolls to detect hidden characters are made at a -3 external penalty; the character cannot sort out true feelings of being watched from the ever-present oppression of the sun. This unnatural Illusion costs one Willpower to resist for a scene, and cannot be made to permanently vanish until the Solar lifts his curse. Moreover, the feelings instilled by this Charm are not wholly false—the sun’s light shows the Solar all of the target’s failings. Whenever the target fails a Virtue roll or spends Willpower to suppress a Virtue while touched by the light of the sun, the Solar is granted a vision of the target’s moment of self-compromise. If the target is a creature of darkness, the sun’s heat stifles them even indoors or at night; the character suffers a -1 external penalty to all actions while this Charm remains in effect. If in direct sunlight, such wretches suffer a blistering heat environmental effect (see Exalted, p. 131)."

He sees the Exalt’s silhouette watching him from rooftops or following him through crowds. The Solar seems to be watching more often than not, always vanishing if confronted directly. This is an unnatural Illusion effect which costs two Willpower to ignore for a scene; the effects of the Charm end once the target has spent a total of twenty Willpower fighting it.

All onboard the vessel hears the words in their mind as if the Solar were speaking from just behind them, allowing the ship to carry out orders from afar without distracting the captain from other tasks.

Upon first purchasing this Charm, the Solar’s the effect corresponding to his caste. Additional powers may be purchased for two experience points each. The Solar’s vessel may only benefit from one effect at a time.\n• Dawn: For three motes, the Solar’s ship becomes an extension of his terrifying might for the rest of the scene — the minds of his opponents are clouded with fear at the thought of the reprisals that would be invited by assaulting such a vessel. Opponents must pay two points of Willpower to ignore this unnatural Compulsion if they wish to target the ship with their attacks. This power in no way prevents the ship’s crew from being targeted.\n• Zenith: For three motes, the Solar’s ship becomes Holy ground for the rest of the scene. Any creature of darkness boarding the vessel enters an environmental hazard with Damage (Essence/2)A/action, Trauma (Sail).\n• Twilight: The ship becomes aware of all threats approaching within (Essence x 30) yards, from above, below, or beside the ship; this warning is communicated to the Solar in the form of eerie sea-sounds which appraise him of the position and bearing of the threat (for example, something below the ship and approaching fast). This benefit costs one mote, and lasts for one day.\n• Night: For three motes, a mist rises up around the ship’s shrouding it from view. This grants a +3 bonus to all Stealth attempts, and reduces the cost of Sea Ambush Technique by one point of Willpower.\n• Eclipse: The Solar may pay five motes to cause his anima to surmount the ship as a flag bearing complex sigils which may be understood by all observers. This flag may offer the terms of a truce, alliance, or financial arrangement. It is clear that this offer is genuine, and magically binding; should the captain of another vessel verbally agree to the terms offered by this flag, that fact becomes Obvious to the Solar and he may pay one Willpower to sanctify the oath as though with the Eclipse anima power. Additionally, if the character is a member of the Eclipse caste, he may sanctify any oath spoken aboard his ship that he is aware of for a cost of only one point of Willpower.\nAt Sail 6+, Essence 6+ this Charm gains the Stackable Keyword, and the Solar may simultaneously apply up to (Essence - 4) different effects at a time."
