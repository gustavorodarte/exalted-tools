This Charm then adds one die to that roll for each mote spent. This Charm is the paradigmatic dice adder. The rule that Solars are prohibited from increasing a dice pool by more than their (Attribute + Ability) almost always refers to the purchase of dice through the use of this Charm.\n Characters can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability, usually to increase a Defense Value, for example, by increasing (Dexterity + Dodge) to protect against a physical attack. When enhancing static values, her player rolls one die for each mote spent on the First Excellency. Each success increases her effective (Attribute + Ability) rating for the task by two. Therefore, each success on the First Excellency roll increases an applicable static value by one.\n Characters cannot use this or other Excellences or dice-adding Charms to \u201ccreate\u201d actions. For example, if a character attacks on tick 3 and will attack again on tick 8, she cannot buy dice for an attack on tick 4 that only exists because she used the Excellency to conjure dice for it. A character who uses this or other reflexive Charms to add to an attack can also use it to enhance her defense until the next tick when she acts, but she must spend Essence for each separate roll she wishes to modify.\n This Charm can be part of a Combo or used together with the Second Excellency, but it is incompatible with the Third Excellency.

The Exalt then spends up to (Attribute + Ability) in motes. This Charm adds one success to a roll for every two motes spent. Each success purchased with Essence Triumphant is the equivalent of purchasing two dice with the First Excellency or some other dice adder. Therefore, if a Solar had a (Dexterity + Melee) total of 8, he could purchase up to four successes with the Second Excellency. Any magical effects that hinge on the character buying dice will then react as if the character had just bought eight (Dexterity + Melee) dice. The character could not add dice from the effects of other Charms because he has reached his maximum of eight by purchasing the four successes.\n The Exalt can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability. Each two motes spent increases his effective (Attribute + Ability) rating for one task by two.\n This means that every two motes spent on this Excellency increase a static value like a DV by one. The First Excellency is thus considerably more efficient for increasing static values than the Second Excellency, but not reliably so.\n This Charm can be in a Combo or used together with the First Excellency, but it is incompatible with the Third Excellency, and it can never be used on the same roll as the Third Excellency."

This Charm always destroys wooden ammunition when it\u2019s used.\n Dazzling Flare: The Solar\u2019s arrow (or other ammunition) glows with holy fire or brilliant sunlight.

In addition, if the attack does health levels of damage to the target, that target\u2019s anima display rises by a number of motes commensurate to the peripheral motes spent on the attack. Because the Solar is shooting out her own anima, this Charm expressly allows her to tag non-Exalted opponents with anima displays. All targets struck with Flashing Sunspot Attack suffer the same Stealth deficiencies as characters flaring their anima banners (see Exalted, p. 114).\n The second use of this Charm folds into the first use: the character may spend one mote to activate this Charm. However, instead of attacking a particular opponent, she may fire her anima into the scenery in an attempt to uncover hidden opponents. As above, any additional peripheral motes she spends on this activation are voided. Upon making this shot, her current anima display automatically drops down a level. Where her arrow lands, it creates a heatless bonfire of Solar anima 50 yards in diameter making stealth in the vicinity of the flare impossible. A Solar in the 8-10 range of anima display may choose instead to pay two motes to make this shot, dropping her down two full levels and creating a bonfire 100 yards in diameter. By paying a third mote, the Solar can void an 11-15 mote display, creating a bonfire 200 yards in diameter. Characters who use this Charm to drop their anima into the 1-3 range are considered to have spent only a single mote of peripheral Essence for the purposes of rebuilding their anima banner.\n At Essence 4+, the Solar may use the one mote version of this Charm to move bonfires she has created by shooting through them.

Defending herself is not good enough; even if a star should fall, the Exalt may use Guarding Star Tactics to deflect it away from all that she wishes to protect by an unrivaled display of power. This Charm serves as a permanent upgrade to Heavenly Guardian Defense, allowing it to be activated with a five mote surcharge to serve as a perfect parry against any area-of-effect attack, environmental damage effect, or ranged attack from a complementary unit\u2014a parry which destroys or turns aside the offending attack. Players should feel free to invent suitably dramatic stunts to express the way in which attacks are defeated.\n Attacks may be divided into two categories: transitory and sustained.\n \u2022 Transitory: Transitory attacks are attacks composed of non-imperishable physical matter, energy, or non-permanent environmental hazards. Defending against a transitory attack destroys that effect utterly at the point where it intersects the Lawgiver\u2019s weapon, preventing it from harming anything behind the Solar, or any complementary unit he is a special character in.\n \u2022 Sustained: Sustained attacks include attacks made of the five magical materials, attacks which are part of the body of a living being, permanent environmental hazards, and environmental hazards or attacks which the Storyteller deems unsuitable to arbitrary destruction. Attacks made with imperishable materials (such as a rain of jade arrows) are simply scattered and deflected without harm. Attacks made by permanent environmental hazards (such as the Pole of Fire) are stilled within (Essence) miles for (Essence) actions. Attacks made by living environmental hazards (such as the winds of Adorjan or a Lunar using a swarm Knack) are prevented from moving to intersect or bypass the position of Solar or any complementary unit he is a member of until their DV has refreshed. Attacks unsuitable for arbitrary destruction are generally one-of-a-kind storyline events, and are deflected or otherwise handled according to the Storyteller\u2019s discretion."

Using Yozi-Fighting Principle, the Lawgiver\u2019s killing instinct expands to encompass foes which are armies unto themselves. By conceptualizing all such combatants as intrinsically linked, the character may extend the actions he takes against one opponent to all of them, enabling him to face impossible odds and engage in legendary battles which form the heart of mythology.\n While Yozi-Fighting Principle is in effect, any Charm activated against or in response to a networked being is considered to have had its cost pre-paid for use against all other elements of that networked being. This cost discount applies until the Exalt\u2019s next action.\n For example: A Solar is attacked by Ligier and activates a combo of Heavenly Guardian Defense and Solar Counterattack, paying normally for this defense and counterattack. Before his next action, he is subjected to a two-attack flurry by soul, Gervesin. The character may activate Heavenly Guardian Defense and Solar Counterattack for no cost in response to Gervesin\u2019s first attack, but would need to pay for it against his second. Then, Malfeas himself strikes the Solar with a three attack flurry. The Solar may use Solar Counterattack and Heavenly Guardian Defense twice in response to the titan\u2019s onslaught for no cost, but would have to pay a third set of activations.\n \u201cNetworked beings\u201d are considered to be creatures whose sum totality of being is encompassed by multiple bodies \u2014 Yozis and Primordials are the premiere example, but the Emanations of an unshaped raksha also count. This Charm is effective moving both \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 a Yozi\u2019s chain of souls \u2014 an attack against Gervesin could roll over into a discount against Malfeas as easily as an attack against Malfeas could roll over into a discount against Gervesin. Attacks against Exalted are never discounted, though in the bizarre event that an Exalt somehow began growing subsidiary souls, attacks directed at the Exalt would provide a discount to then target her souls. Exalted Akuma form an exception to this rule \u2014 they are considered a part of the Yozi they have sold themselves to, and may be fully treated as such by this Charm."

While her anima flares at the (11+)-mote level, she may also burn corpses for a cost of 0m with a touch, and the minimum damage of attacks directed at creatures of darkness is raised by one die.\n \u2022 Twilight (Occult): When her anima flares at the (11+)- mote level, the Exalt reduces the cost of all sorcery effects by half or (Essence x2), whichever is less. This reduction does not apply to necromancy.\n \u2022 Nigh (Stealth): The difficulty of rolls to track or notice the character rises by (Essence) rather than (Essence/2).\n \u2022 Eclipse (Socialize): The Exalt takes the laws of Heaven into her own hands. Whenever someone breaks an oath she has sanctified, the Eclipse is immediately aware of both the transgression and transgressor. Indeed, if she so desires, the Solar may even specify the circumstances in which the oath-breaker\u2019s botches will manifest (though subject to Storyteller approval). The Exalt may not actually forgive the oath-breaker of any punishment, and Heaven will vent its wrath in the usual manner if the Storyteller judges that the specified circumstances are implausible enough that the transgressor is unlikely to ever actually suffer punishment.

Yet, he may enjoy the benefits of this higher Essence rating only while Glory to the Most High is active. When the Charm is not active, he is treated as though his Essence rating is whatever it would be if he did not possess Glory to the Most High, and as though he did not possess any Charms or dots that this lower Essence rating would not permit him to obtain.\n The Solar\u2019s anima immediately flares to its full iconic splendor when Glory to the Most High is activated and stay this way all the time the Charm is active. The character also gains 10 motes of Essence (three in the Personal Essence pool, seven in the Peripheral Essence pool) filling out the sudden difference in his Essence pool\u2019s capacity.\n When this Charm ends, the character must roll the higher of (Essence) or his primary Virtue, and add a number of points of Limit equal to his successes.

        "Info": "Exalts can purchase this Charm once per Virtue rated 5+ and that the character has the Phoenix Renewal Tactic Charm for it. The Charm\u2019s effects recede if the Solar lacks a sufficient Virtue rating for whatever reason.\n The Lawgiver regains one channel for each Virtue augmented by this Charm once per day at sunset. Additionally, whenever a Solar would roll dice for a Virtue enhanced by a purchase of this Charm (whether as a pool by itself or bonus dice from a channel), the Charm converts these dice into automatic successes. This isn\u2019t optional, so characters must always spend Willpower to resist the urges of extreme Virtue. See below for how Virtues express themselves differently through this Charm.\n This is not the only form of extreme Virtue Solars of the First Age explored, only one transhumanist paradigm.\n Compassion: The Solar cares for other people as she would care about the chips of bone or fibers of sinew that compose someone she cares about. She certainly does not wish the pieces harm, but places their wellbeing far below the health of the whole. The specifics of the Solar\u2019s greater good must be worked out with the Storyteller and must make sense for the character\u2019s Intimacies and other Virtue ratings. Within this expansive ethos, she can sacrifice millions of lives to save billions more. She can channel Compassion on any action that serves her greater good, even actions that oppose smaller conceptions of Compassion. However, she must spend Willpower to take actions that oppose the greater good, even those actions that demonstrate immediate Compassion.\n Conviction: Inhuman extremes of Conviction do not wildly deviate from the ethics of mortal paragons except by degree. Therefore, the applicability of Conviction channels does not increase. However, whenever mental influence seeks to alter the emotional context of any of her Intimacies, lessen them outright or alter her beliefs or memory with an Illusion effect, the Exalt may spend one Willpower and one Conviction channel to perfectly dodge that influence. Doing so breaks any ongoing effects from the dodged influence, and this may be done later to throw off influence as an alternative to dodging the initial social attack or other source. In addition to the normal behavioral prohibitions on high Conviction, a Solar with this Charm can\u2019t knowingly act against any of her Intimacies unless she has spent Willpower to act against her beliefs for a scene.\n Temperance: With extreme self-control comes absolute clarity of purpose. Whenever mental influence would build an Intimacy or exert an Emotion effect over her, the Solar may dodge by spending one Willpower and one Temperance channel. This defense follows the same overall rules as the dodge afforded by Epic Zeal of Conviction apart from the types of influence it defends against. The range of actions that extreme Temperance can enhance does not improve. Unfortunately, her ascetic devotion also requires her to spend Willpower to act dishonestly or show bias in any situation, not just matters of importance. She must also spend Willpower to break promises, even those lacking that formality and solemnity of a sworn oath.\n Valor: The Solar knows no peers or superiors and, therefore, ceases to understand fear as a meaningful concept. If she would somehow fail a Valor check despite 5+ automatic successes, she still succeeds with threshold of one. She treats all mental influence that would instill fear or alter her behavior through playing on fears as unacceptable orders, also terminating any fear-based Intimacies upon purchase of this Charm. The Storyteller decides when this defense applies. Epic Zeal of Valor does not broaden the range of actions that Valor channels can aid, nor does it broaden the scope of prohibited actions."

The Solar chooses between them each time she uses the Charm. Two methods last as long as the Solar continues to sing, play, orate or the like, and spends Essence each action to maintain the Charm. The third is an instant attack. For each form, however, the Solar\u2019s player must roll (Charisma + Performance) to initiate the attack. A character gains one attack form when she learns the Charm. Additional applications cost an additional experience point each, or all three attack forms for one bonus point. A character can use only one attack form at a time. Activating the Charm costs Willpower. Continuing it merely costs Essence (for the two continuing effects).\n Area, Continuing: The Solar inflicts one level of lethal damage per two motes spent each action, to a maximum of (Essence) damage. Targets can soak this damage only with Stamina or soak-enhancing Charms. The Solar\u2019s lethal performance affects everyone whose Dodge MDV is less than the number of successes from the attack roll. Continuing the attack counts as the character\u2019s Charm use for each action.\n Single Target, Continuing: The Solar\u2019s chosen victim suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage per action that the Solar continues the Charm. This effect costs three motes per action. The initial attack roll must exceed the victim\u2019s Dodge MDV. Continuing the attack counts as the character\u2019s Charm use for each action.\n Single Target, Instant: The Solar spends up to her (Stamina + Essence) in motes and inflicts that many dice of lethal damage, plus extra successes from the attack roll. The target can resist this damage only with Stamina or soak-enhancing Charms. The attack cannot be parried without a Charm or stunt, but it can be dodged like a normal ranged attack."

For a larger group, the Solar supervises the process of building this shelter (an action normally requiring one hour), but otherwise using the same process as described above.\n This Charm protects an area large enough to house the Solar and up to her Essence in Magnitude of her followers.

Wyld berries will not poison them, nor singing fish give them mutations. The iridescent locusts which swarm across the sands of Cecelyne will not infect them with demonic taint.\n Finally, the Solar\u2019s Food-Gathering Exercise may secure enough food to feed the entire camp with only a single use \u2014 even if there is no food to be had in the region. As if produced by faith alone, the Solar finds clean water flowing from the rocks of Malfeas, fresh fish in the acrid seas of Kimbery, and living fruit upon dead branches.\n A second purchase of this Charm at Survival 7+, Essence 7+ sanctifies the camp as Holy ground.

(See Exalted, pg. 132-133 for guidelines on Academic Knowledge actions.)\n In addition, when making Academic Knowledge rolls, the Solar may substitute her Lore Ability for any other Ability. The action can benefit from Excellences of both Abilities, calculating its dice limit based on the character\u2019s Lore or the Ability for which it is substituting, whichever is higher. Such actions can also benefit from information recall and synthesis Charms from both Abilities.\n As with most Charm-assisted forms of knowledge mastery, this Charm enhances the recall and unifying synthesis of things the character already knows. It does not enable the Exalt to make normally invalid information rolls, nor does it aid actions that are primarily about the practical application of knowledge. For example, per Operate Technology/Artifact (Exalted, pp. 136-137), this Charm can enhance (Intelligence + Lore) rolls to understand a device\u2019s function, but it will not enhance the (Wits + Lore) rolls to actually operate an unfamiliar artifact.\n With Essence 3+, even when her insight may not surmount the obscurity of a given subject immediately, the Solar\u2019s victory over ignorance is inevitable. Each time she fails a knowledge check, she accumulates a bonus die on her next roll to recall or piece together the same information, up to a limit of (Essence) extra dice that do not count as a dice bonus from Charms. She also ignores the retry penalty on such rolls (Exalted, p. 121). These benefits last until the end of the current story."

        "Info": "As masters of the Old Realm, the Solar Exalted used the Wyld-Shaping Technique to conquer chaos and expand Creation. They stood at the edge of the world and forced shape into the teeth of the howling storm. This Charm forces a region of the Wyld to take form as the Exalt commands.\n Wyld-Shaping Technique is an extended dramatic action. The dice pool used equals (the Solar\u2019s Intelligence + Lore). Each roll requires five hours of effort, and the character pays the Charm\u2019s cost with each roll. To create some things the storyteller could reason that the Solar should have some other ability requirements. This roll has a base difficulty of 1 in regions of Pure Chaos, 3 in the Deep Wyld, 5 in the Middlemarches, and 7 in the Bordermarches of the Wyld.\n When the Lawgiver has accumulated a sufficient number of successes, she must spend them all at once, ending the Charm. Unspent successes are wasted. Successes may be spent in the following manner:\n Land: The primary purpose of Wyld-Shaping Technique is to expand the borders of Creation. A single use of Wyld-Shaping Technique will restructure one waypoint within the Wyld, creating a new landscape roughly 10 miles in diameter per success. The quality of the created land depends on the number of successes spent. One success will create a near-worthless land: blasted heath, barren desert, lifeless ocean. Three successes permit the creation of useful land: arable farmland, swampland with some herbal resources, desert with sufficient water to support settlement and some mineral resources, forests stocked with game. Five successes create valuable land: ideal farmland, forests full of valuable wood, hills or mountains thick with rich mineral veins, oceans teeming with fish or rare coral beds.\n Six-success landscapes sometimes contain veins of jade. Orichalcum and moonsilver never occur naturally in Wyld-Shaped lands, but gold and silver suitable for refinement into magical materials are a possibility. Wyld-Shaping Technique may not create landscapes containing soulsteel or starmetal.\n The amount of riches someone can take out of this lands is equal to (successes) Resources per year (max 5) for (successes) years, considering a work force suitable and able to explore the kind of riches produced on the land. Additional successes may be spent to increase the amount of resources per year or the number of years it will last. The Solar can add more workforce, reducing the amount of time the riches would last. Some of the riches may be self-replenishing and in this case, the time by which the land produces the riches is increased to whenever the sufficient care is taken to maintain it.\n Landscapes made with Wyld-Shaping Technique must be congruent with their surroundings if created within the Bordermarches, Middlemarches, or Deep Wyld. Within the East, for example, a Solar would need to create heavily wooded or vegetation-rich lands; he could not march deep into the Eastern forests and create thirty miles of sandy desert. This does not preclude the possibility of incongruous landscapes, it simply means that the Solars must use previous iterations of Wyld-Shaping Technique to gradually shift the landscape toward something that will accept his desired topography. For example, young Solars in the First Age often forged high mountains ranges in the North with Wyld-Shaping Technique as a prelude to creating deep, sheltered valleys in which they could shape wondrous and fertile gardens. This restriction vanishes in Pure Chaos, where the Solar may create whatever he likes, but the created land will still be subject to the powerful emanations of the nearby Elemental Pole \u2014 unless the Solar possesses other stabilizing measures, he should not expect his arid far-Eastern desert to remain barren for very long.\n Wyld-Shaping Technique may not be used to produce shadowlands.\n Exotic Wonders: Three to five successes will permit the Solar to create a unique wonder. These items are rarely useful in and of themselves, but are invaluable as components for artifact crafting, and Wyld-Shaping Technique enables Solars to create wonders that could be obtained in no other way. The number of successes required to create a wonder is set at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion, based on the impossibility of the object. Frozen lightning, colorless flame, singing shells and flowers in hues the eye cannot see are all examples of three-success prodigies. Five successes tend to produce the intangible-made-tangible. Five successes will produce happiness captured in a small lacquered box, the scent of sorrow, or a harlot\u2019s lost innocence, all delivered in a form suitable for artifact crafting. This Charm cannot recreate anything the Solar can obtain by any other means, no matter how rare or singular; essentially, some artifacts require \u201ca (specific) impossible wonder\u201d as an exotic component; these things may only be obtained with Wyld-Shaping Technique. If a Solar needs a behemoth\u2019s bones to forge an artifact, he must de-bone a behemoth. If he needs the blood of a Dragon-Blooded general, he must go looking for a Dragon-Blooded general.\n Wealth: The Solar may create wealth by expending two successes per Resources dot of treasure desired (to a maximum of Resources 5). This is always created in a non-useful form \u2014 cowrie shells, mounds of silver dinars (at a level of purity insufficient for conversion into moonsilver), or heaping mounds of jewels are all examples of wealth that might be produced. This function will not create a jeweled dagger, unless it is of sufficiently poor make to be unsuitable for use as a weapon, nor will it create jade currency.\n Land, exotic wonders, and wealth created with Wyld-Shaping Technique are not quite fully real in and of themselves. Their reality stems from Creation \u2014 from the reality of the Lawgivers, the Imperial Mountain, and the Loom of Fate. As long as the created things continue to interact with things of Creation, as through the magical trade networks established in the Old Realm to tame the Wyld, they survive. If something created by this Charm fails to interact extensively with the things of Creation during a story, it begins to lose its reality. Roll its creator\u2019s Essence against either difficulty 1, or, if the Solar\u2019s creation does not interact with reality at all during the story, difficulty 2. After three consecutive failures during which the creation does not interact with things of reality extensively, wonders and wealth cease to exist. Land becomes a Wyld-infected zone of the severity it held before being Wyld-Shaped. Exotic wonders forged into artifacts are always considered to be interacting with reality by virtue of being integrated into an artifact.\n Raksha who find themselves within Wyld-Shaped landscape which has not interacted with any Creation-born for one season and which currently contains no Creation-born may launch a Shaping attack against the landscape as though it were a waypoint. Success will cause the landscape to automatically fail its next stability roll. Activating Wyld-Shaping Technique sends enormous ripples out through the local Wyld, automatically alerting all Fair Folk within five journeys that the Charm is being used, and where."

The magnitude number is for human sized creatures and it must be taken into consideration. For example, a horse is equivalent to two humans. If the Solar expends 4 successes, she can get up to 37 horses. Created creatures may not possess any mutations from scratch \u2014 exotic modifications are the province of training Charms or Craft (Genesis).\n Demesnes: To forge a demesne, the Solar must first accumulate successes sufficient to create the land it will occupy. He must then spend two success per desired dot rating of the demesne, up to level-3. The fourth and fifth dots of a demesne\u2019s rating cost four successes each. By default, this will create a demesne appropriate to the landscape, always an elemental demesne. Solars may spend two extra success to create a Solar-aspected demesne, but only if the underlying landscape is a five-success landscape. Alternately, four extra successes may be added to produce other-aspected demesnes, but only in landscapes worth four or more successes.\n Land/Wealth: The Solar may create real land and wealth (now including jade currency) with Wyld-Shaping Technique, not subject to withering when out of contact with reality. Doing so doubles the required success cost of the created land or wealth.\n Mutations: The Solar must spend one success per dot of mutation he wishes to apply. This is considered a Wyld mutation. For two successes per dot of mutation, the applied mutations can be considered \u201cnormal\u201d and is inheritable. This allows the Solar to create new species.\n People: The Solar may create useful Essence 1 mortals from the Wyld, generating one individual per success. An additional success renders a created mortal heroic. Created mortals may not possess any mutations from scratch \u2014 exotic modifications are the province of training Charms or Craft (Genesis). The Solar defines the mortal\u2019s Motivation and basic memories. Use the mortal creation system (Exalted Corebook pg, 81) to create the mortals as the Solar wishes. Charisma, Manipulation, Intelligence, Wits and none of the mortal abilities may be higher than the ones of the Solar.\n Individuals created with Wyld Cauldron Technology are not subject to withering away when out of contact with things of Creation, but are not fully integrated into Creation\u2019s cycles of life and death, either. Their soul is an artificial thing forged of compressed and calcified chaos, and will attempt to return to that state upon death \u2014 they cannot leave behind a ghost or reincarnate unless Heaven takes steps to specifically incorporate the individual into the cycle of reincarnation. Wyld-Shaped heroic individuals are potentially eligible for Celestial Exaltation, although the Solars of the Old Realm were never able to confirm or debunk this fact to their satisfaction. Exaltation immediately completes the soul of a Wyld-Shaped hero, ensuring that it will continue on beyond death as normal."

        "Info": "The concepts which engender the universe fall readily into the grasp of the Solar Exalted. Emptying himself of all thought and desire, the Lawgiver becomes a vessel for the knowledge of the shinma. Entering a trance state, his eyes become unblinking lanterns and his caste mark appears, glowing the same stark white for one full day. During this time, the Solar subtly alters universal principles with the force of her will, to great effect. The character may use Shinmaic Communion to target a landscape he has created with Wyld-Shaping Technique, redefining its relationship with the great cosmic elements known as the shinma. The character gains ten \u2018points\u2019 with which to edit the region in accordance to his will, which may be spent on the following modifications:\n \u2022 Nirupadhika, the Way, governs spatial relationships. For one point the Solar may enchant the roads in the region such that they prevent travelers moving along them from getting lost, or infallibly lead them to specific places regardless of where they intend to travel. Two points allow the Solar to speed up or slow down travel according to his design; by default, this halves or doubles travel times, though each point invested beyond the initial two raises this by a factor of one. Three points may designate points within the region as impossible to miss, or occlude them so that all efforts to find them suffer an external penalty equal to half the Solar\u2019s Lore. Four points make the region mobile, able to move (Solar\u2019s Lore miles / day). Each additional point spent on mobility doubles the region\u2019s movement rate. Five points doubles the interior size of the region without altering the size of its borders\u2014the region is simply bigger on the inside. Each additional point spent on this aspect increases the region\u2019s size by a factor of one.\n \u2022 Dharma, the Cup, governs corrosion, ignorance and desire. For one point, staying within the region for at least one week counts as a scene spent building an Intimacy of hatred toward a particular social group not native to the region. Two points cause each week spent within the region to count as a scene eroding an Intimacy of the Solar\u2019s choice. Three points create a tenor of desire within the region according to the Solar\u2019s definition; all actions which directly reject this desire are taken at a -2 internal penalty, while all actions in pursuit of it enjoy a +1 circumstantial bonus die. Four points produce a regional agenda\u2014the Solar defines an Intimacy, and each time an individual sleeps within the region, this counts as a scene spent building that Intimacy. Five points hide knowledge about a particular thing from those within the region, inflicting an external penalty equal to (Solar\u2019s Lore / 2) on all attempts to uncover information about the thing; alternately, the Solar may ensure that anyone who seeks a certain thing will find it. This thing must exist within the region, be intangible, of limitless supply, and likely to bring the individual significant turmoil in the future. Valid examples, then, might include worldly insight, occult secrets, or love.\n \u2022 Nirvishesha, the Ring, governs identity. One point raises or lowers the region\u2019s level of Wyld infection by one stage, for example changing a Tainted Land to a stretch of Bordermarches. Two points summon a certain common variety of little god or minor elemental to flock to the region, according to the Solar\u2019s will (consider the differences between a region full of field gods as compared with one full of bloody hands). Three points may create or close a shadowland within the region, with a diameter no greater than one mile. Four points may create an Essence bias within the region with the same range of flavors as demesnes enjoy (the five elements, Solar, Lunar, vitriol, etcetera). Beings matching this Essence bias raise their hourly respiration rate by four motes. Five points may alter the cycle of life and death within the region. This may guarantee that all souls go on to lethe, linger as ghosts, or plunge into Oblivion; or it might create a closed reincarnation loop, where all residents who enter lethe within the region are guaranteed to reincarnate somewhere within its borders.\n \u2022 Nishkriya, the Sword, governs conflict. For one point, the region takes on a martial tenor\u2014its people slowly become more generally warlike and inclined to the ways of battle. Each season spent within the region acts as a scene of building a positive intimacy of some kind toward conflict into the Policy of all social groups. For two points, the region becomes a magnet for conflict\u2014it will begin to produce natural resources needed or coveted more by the region\u2019s neighbors than by the region itself. For three points, the region becomes a den of brotherly raiders\u2014all military units raised within the region have a Drill one higher than normal, and all individuals enjoy a +2 situational bonus to all attempts to take something from another person or group by force. Four points formidably defends the region against invasion\u2014its animals attack intruding military forces, and the land itself rises up in protest, causing all movement to be across what is considered difficult terrain, and producing a -1 external penalty to all military activities by invaders. Five points tithed to Nishkriya turns the region into a weapon against hostile forces attempting to move into the Lawgiver\u2019s domain, raining down at least one environmental attack per hour against any invading military unit, of a sort devised by the Solar\u2014avalanches, rains of lightning, supernatural ice storms and localized earthquakes are only the beginning of the woes that may be hurled at unwelcome guests.\n \u2022 Nirvikalpa, the Staff, is the medium through which communication occurs. One dot makes the region a gathering place for societies, by increasing its yield of timber or making it more fecund farmland. Two dots make the region a magnet for commerce, increasing the amount or value of mineral resources found within. Three dots make the region a point of interaction between its inhabitants and the supernatural world, by seeding the region either with raw materials capable of being refined into the magical materials, or with those materials directly. Four dots makes the region a point of communion between Creation and Heaven, by causing each prayer uttered within the region to count as though it had been spoken from five mouths rather than one. Five dots makes the region a communication network between Creation and itself, drawing dragon lines together to create a three-dot demesne. This value may be raised by one dot per additional point invested.\n The Solar is not obligated to spend \u2018left-over\u2019 points, if he does not wish to do so. A region may only be affected by one use of Shinmaic Communion at a time; additional uses cancel any existing alterations and overwrite them. Shinmaic Communion\u2019s effects vanish upon the Solar\u2019s death, unless a surcharge of one permanent point of Willpower is paid upon the Charm\u2019s activation.\n This Charm may be purchased up to (Lore) times. Each purchase after the first grants two additional points to spend on shinmaic alterations."

        "Info": "Having communed with the foundational elements of the cosmos, the Solars forge miracles. This Charm must be activated in a region the Solar has altered with Shinmaic Communion. The character defines a wondrous aspect or blessing for inclusion within the region. Much like artifact crafting, this Charm is conceptually broad and depends on cooperation between players and Storytellers to design uncanny wonders that later Ages will disbelievingly mythologize and dream of. The parameters of the effect depend on the Shinmaic Communion elements affecting the region this Charm is used in.\n \u2022 Nirvikalpa determines the power of the miracle. One point affecting the region permits the Solar to produce works equivalent to mundane effort. Two points may produce uncanny effects equivalent to thaumaturgy. Three points produce wonders equivalent to Terrestrial Circle sorcery. Four points are equivalent to the Celestial Circle, and five points may produce awe-inspiring effects comparable to Solar Circle sorcery. Zero points limits the effects to only the weakest happenstance, the equivalent of mood lighting\u2014effects with no mechanical repercussions at all.\n \u2022 Nishkriya determines the strategy of the miracle. Each point of Nishkriya invested in the region allows one trigger to be built into the miracle. Examples of potential triggers include \u201centering the region,\u201d \u201cpraying to the Yozis,\u201d \u201csleeping within the region,\u201d \u201cstealing from a merchant,\u201d \u201cmarching under the flag of a foreign power,\u201d or \u201cdisguising one\u2019s identity.\u201d\n .\u2022 Dharma determines who the miracle affects. One point permits only a very limited subset of a population\u2014old men of Varangian descent. Two points allows the miracle to affect a population\u2014Varangians. Three points permits a category of magical beings to be targeted (such as gods, or Dragon-Blooded). Four points affect all individuals who wish to be affected. Five points allows the miracle to target everyone within the region. Zero points limits the miracle to working upon the environment; it cannot affect people at all.\n \u2022 Nirvishesha determines how long the miracle persists. One point causes the effect to last unto the third generation (60 years). Two points last unto the seventh generation (140 years). Three points last until the 30th generation (600 years). Four points last unto the 50th generation (1,000 years). Five points create a permanent miracle. Zero points invested in Nirvishesha produces a miracle lasting a single paltry year.\n \u2022 Nirupadhika determines the scope of the miracle. One point affects all regions the Solar has shaped out of the Wyld within a single Direction. Two points affect all such regions he has shaped within the boundaries of Creation, and any realms of the Faraway which he has visited. Three points affect all of the above, as well as the entirety of Creation. Four points affect all of Creation as well as all directly adjoining realms (the Underworld, Malfeas, Yu-Shan, Autochthonia, the Wyld). Five points are conjectured to affect all of existence\u2014even those conceptual frontiers the Exalted have yet to discover or invent. Zero points invested in Nirupadhika affects only the Shinmaic Communion-marked region in which the Charm is used.\n For example, a Solar might lay a blessing of protection on a region lasting for seven generations, so that all invading armies are scoured at its borders by enormous pillars of white-hot sunfire and other horrifying manifestations of Adamant Circle destruction. This would require that the region be affected by two points under Nirvishesha, five under Dharma, five under Nirvikalpa, and two under Nishkriya. Or a Solar might attempt to permanently ennoble all the cosmos so that anyone attempting to initiate into the practice of sorcery will receive this tutelage by the world itself. This would require five points of Nirupadhika, five points of Nirvishesha, four points of Dharma, one of Nishkriya, and two points of Nirvikalpa.\n Crafting a miracle is an extended dramatic action using a dice pool of (Intelligence + Lore) with an interval of one day, a difficulty of (points of Nirupadhika used), and a cumulative difficulty of (total number of points used x 10). Abandoning the effort at any point before completion causes the effect to unravel harmlessly, and the Solar is refunded the xp cost of the Charm. A botch causes the miracle to erupt in some dangerous and unpredictable manner\u2014at best, everyone in the region is likely to have a very interesting day.\n This Charm\u2019s miracles take effect automatically once crafting is complete, unless the Solar has utilized one or more points of Nirupadhika. In that case the miracle becomes what is known as a shinmaic potentiality or \u201cMiracle Shell,\u201d an Essence-shaped working which exists in potential but does not interface with Creation. Greater arts than Shinmaic Calibration are required to integrate a Miracle Shell into reality\u2014the Salinan Working is likely the most well-known example of such an integration."

This God is equivalent to a spirit of the second rank or third rank, depending on the virulence and magnitude of the disease and its outbreak (see The Compass of Celestial Directions, vol. III\u2014Yu-Shan, pp.122-124) The spirit always has the Bane Weapon Charm, which is efficacious against other spirits of the disease it represents, and a special Charm called Consume Sickness, which allows the spirit to spend 10 motes to draw out the sickness it represents from a person and consume it, gaining a point of Willpower or restocking a Virtue channel in the process. This Charm may only function if a number of individuals of Magnitude 6 or above are infected with the disease within the targeted area."

It involves a complex, delicate 12-hour medical procedure that resets the Essence flows of the target\u2019s body and mends instabilities of the flesh. At the end of the process, the target is physically returned to the flower of youth \u2014 18 years of age for humans, or the proportional equivalent for animals. The target retains all memories and skills. This procedure is efficacious only when used on behalf of mortals or animals, and it wears off after a year and a day, returning the target to his previous age unless the Solar chooses to renew the Charm\u2019s application with another 12-hour procedure. Alternatively, the Lawgiver\u2019s player may choose to spend one experience point in addition to the standard cost of the Charm, removing the need for upkeep. The target will then begin to age normally from the point of his \u201creset\u201d youth. At Medicine 10, Essence 10, the experience point cost for enduring youth disappears. The Solar is still capable, though, of performing the Charm so that the target requires yearly maintenance.\n A second purchase of this Charm at Medicine 10, Essence 10 allows this charm to be applied to magic beings as well, making even Exalted time-immortal."

        "Info": "Each Absorption\u2014Devonian, Salinan or Silurian \u2014 offers characters a choice of special abilities. The player picks two. Storytellers can invent more powers for the three Absorptions, if they like. If this benefit seems too powerful for a series, Storytellers can restrict characters to one power per Absorption, or raise the Essence prerequisite to 6.\n Devonian: A Devonian master must believe in the repeatable, calculable nature of Essence and the power of careful observation, logic and experiment. She also must conduct extensive experiments in natural and supernatural science, adding a further minimum of Lore 3.\n \u2022 Manse and artifact attunements are repeatable experiments. With a successful (Intelligence + Lore) roll, difficulty ([Manse or Artifact rating] x 2), the sorcerer can attune to such a thing in 20 ticks instead of the usual 20 minutes or so. If she ever succeeds on the roll for a given object, thereafter she always succeeds again.\n \u2022 When a Devonian master analyzes a supernatural effect, her player\u2019s (Intelligence + Occult) roll becomes extended. Each roll represents a week of research and experiment. Given time, she can probably puzzle out any supernatural effect. A single botched roll means the analysis ends in failure \u2014 even the Absorption cannot solve every puzzle of Essence\u2014and Excellences do not apply. The gradual, systematic analysis rules out the flashes of supernatural genius the Excellences represent.\n \u2022 Deep study of each spell helps a Devonian master cast spells despite interruptions. When the character\u2019s Shape Sorcery action is disrupted, she may reflexively apply any Occult Excellency she knows to the (Wits + Occult) roll to carry on with spellcasting.\n Salinan: A Salinan master demonstrates belief that everyone is an individual thought in a universal consciousness, and that all Essence flows most freely in its natural state. Such characters can see meaning and connections in the most surprising things. A Salinan master requires at least Awareness 3 to represent her sensitivity to Creation.\n \u2022 Understanding that herself is simultaneously hers alone and part of Creation\u2019s own nonlocal consciousness, the Salinan master can use Emerald Countermagic against any unnatural mental influence, as long as it is backed by an Essence or Artifact rating no higher than half her own (round up). Using Sapphire Countermagic can counter effects of (Essence/2) + 1. Using Adamant Countermagic can counter effects of up to her full Essence.\n \u2022 A Salinan master can pull information from nowhere (or maybe from the Salinan Working). Whenever his player rolls a threshold of five successes on any Perception or Intelligence roll, the Storyteller imparts a piece of relevant, important information.\n \u2022 Everything is connected to everything else. A Salinan master can apply Creation\u2019s wholeness to arcane links. She can substitute one arcane link for any other to the same subject, no matter what a spell\u2019s description says. (She could use a lock of a victim\u2019s hair, for instance, rather than the required drop of his blood.) What\u2019s more, with three different arcane links to a person or place, she can use them to target any spell.\n Silurian: A Silurian master believes Creation is an arbitrary system of interacting symbols that he can manipulate through its syntax. These sorcerers tend to see everything in terms of symbols and communication: map and territory, call and response, rhetoric and games. Their Absorption requires Linguistics 3 or better.\n \u2022 A Silurian master can block the powers of the Fair Folk, who likewise treat Creation as a fiction they change at will. A Silurian master can use Emerald Countermagic against any Fair Folk Charm or glamour backed by Essence no higher than her own (round up).\n \u2022 Silurian masters excel at recombining the symbolic components of spells. The character can invent new versions of spells he knows, changing one aspect of its manifestation such as the shape of its area, its manifested substance or its elemental source \u2014 but the Essence cost stays the same and the new version cannot offer any net advantage. (For instance, Death of Silver Butterflies offers financial advantage, but doesn\u2019t make the spell more effective as a spell.) The variation costs the character half the experience of learning a truly new spell. Characters who don\u2019t already know the original spell or lack Silurian training pay full cost for the variant spell.\n \u2022 A Silurian master can break symbolic connections to herself. If her player succeeds at a reflexive (Wits + Essence) roll, with a difficulty of the attacking sorcerer\u2019s Essence, the character breaks the arcane link before the spell can affect her."

The concentrated power of the Solar\u2019s will visibly strains the boundaries of existence, causing a localized Calibration more ominous and bizarre than the natural fixing of Creation that marks the beginning and end of each year. For an area of (100 yards for a First Circle demon, 500 for Second Circle demon, and one mile for a Third Circle demon) around her, sunlight bleeds away as surely as the coming of midnight, and sounds somewhere between great hollow wails of torment and the grating of brass echoes out from her location. The Bureau of Destiny is made explicitly aware every time this Charm is used to enhance a summoning, and knows where it was used.\n Whenever this Charm is used to summon a demon of the Third Circle outside of Calibration, the Solar must reflexively make a contested roll of his (Intelligence + Occult) against the Dodge MDV of each Third Circle demon he has currently bound. Failing this roll for a single demon permits all currently bound demons to slip free of their bindings."

Pressing at the outer boundaries of sorcerous understanding, however, she was able to discern a set of cosmological principles more amenable to the thing she had become: the acrid Essence-flows of Kimbery.\n Upon learning this Charm, the character names a single Yozi. She can henceforth learn and use that Yozi\u2019s Charms as though she were a member of the Eclipse Caste, save that she needs no tutor. Primordial Principle Emulation may be purchased a total number of times equal to (Essence - 5), with each purchase covering a different Yozi. The character gains a point of Limit the first time she invokes any Yozi Charm within the scope of a scene. The Yozis are aware of this Charm, having used certain of its principles to help guide the formation of their Green Sun Princes. It has historically pleased them to dispatch their Solar Akuma to suppress knowledge of the Charm. The Ebon Dragon especially enjoys the bitter regret of his gilded slaves when they realize they bartered away their souls needlessly.\n Thanks to the taint of the Great Curse upon their Exaltation, Solars may use this Charm only to unlock the secrets of the mutilated lords of Malfeas. It is possible that a Solar who was somehow cleansed of the Great Curse could also unlock the principles of non-Yozi Primordials. Thankfully, the Abyssal Exalted and their Deathlord masters have never discovered a Charm building off Void Circle Necromancy to gain access to the magics of the slumbering Neverborn.

Magic-Shattering Strike permits the Solar\u2019s attack to disrupt sorcery, necromancy, and Sorcerous-keyword Charms. The Lawgiver targets a spell or appropriate Charm and spends fifteen motes. The Charm or spell must be Obvious to the Lawgiver\u2019s senses to be a valid target for Magic- Shattering Strike. If the attack (which may use any combat Ability) successfully strikes the beneficiary of the spell, then the spell is broken as though targeted by the weakest level of countermagic capable of affecting it. If the spell creates or summons an automaton or spirit, the Lawgiver\u2019s attack must target that automaton or spirit. If the spell is a free-standing effect, such as Rain of Doom, then the attack must be generally aimed at the center of the spell\u2019s area of effect, and the effect is considered to have a Parry DV of (Circle x 3) for spells, or (Minimum Essence + 2) for Sorcerous Charms. Should the Solar successfully shatter a spell or Charm in this fashion, he gains (Spell\u2019s Circle x 4) or (Charm\u2019s Minimum Essence + 2) motes for doing so. Magic-Shattering Strike may explicitly be placed in a Combo with Charms of other Abilities."

Laying a hand up to the Sun and speaking her target\u2019s name, the Solar curses him with the gaze of the wrathful sun. While this Charm remains in effect, sunlight itself becomes the eyes of the Solar\u2026 and the target knows it. Wherever she should go, she feels the Solar\u2019s gaze upon her in the light of the sun. As a result, the target feels constantly watched and followed \u2014 even indoors, she can feel the baleful sun dogging her every step. As a result, all Awareness rolls to detect hidden characters are made at a -3 external penalty; the character cannot sort out true feelings of being watched from the ever-present oppression of the sun. This unnatural Illusion costs one Willpower to resist for a scene, and cannot be made to permanently vanish until the Solar lifts his curse. Moreover, the feelings instilled by this Charm are not wholly false\u2014the sun\u2019s light shows the Solar all of the target\u2019s failings. Whenever the target fails a Virtue roll or spends Willpower to suppress a Virtue while touched by the light of the sun, the Solar is granted a vision of the target\u2019s moment of self-compromise. If the target is a creature of darkness, the sun\u2019s heat stifles them even indoors or at night; the character suffers a -1 external penalty to all actions while this Charm remains in effect. If in direct sunlight, such wretches suffer a blistering heat environmental effect (see Exalted, p. 131).\n At Awareness 6+, Essence 6+ the Solar may use an enhanced version of this Charm costing six motes. Used in this fashion, all targets suffer the effects reserved for creatures of darkness, above. Additionally, if the Solar voluntarily ends this Charm by withdrawing committed Essence, creatures of darkness spontaneously combust in a blaze of sunfire, suffering a one-time environmental damage effect with Damage (Awareness)A, Trauma (Essence) if they are under direct sunlight.\n With Awareness 7+, Essence 7+, the Solar may issue a summons to targets afflicted with either version of this Charm, so long as they are within one mile of her. The summons is Obvious to the target\u2019s senses, as is the location where the Solar expects to meet (also within the same one-mile radius). The target has one day to reach this meeting point, and must arrive in broad daylight. Should she fail to do so, she will be branded with the Creature of Darkness mutation as a Shaping effect."

Beautiful Essence-Born Runes contain more than simply instructions in the use of a Charm or spell, however; when created, they are also designed to encompass additional lessons desired by their creator. In game terms, each glyph contains one Charm or spell, and one Intimacy. Thereafter, characters who study the glyph may learn the spell or Charm coded into it as a Training effect. However, the character also gains the Intimacy coded into the Charm, and it is fundamentally embedded into her understanding of the magic. The learned Charm or spell may not be used while the character does not harbor the encoded Intimacy. This restriction may be overcome, eventually, by spending an additional 2xp.\n Designing a rune takes only (minimum Essence of effect) hours of effort, and a character may design an unlimited number of runes. Actually scribing the rune requires an investiture of Essence, as reflected in the Charm\u2019s cost.\n This charms works as well as an enhancement of Guiding Words of Solar Wisdom, and may substitute the Simple action the requisite charm needs."

This truth is demonstrated clearly by this Charm, through which any ship the Solar commands becomes an extension of his anima. Upon first purchasing this Charm, the Solar\u2019s the effect corresponding to his caste. Additional powers may be purchased for two experience points each. The Solar\u2019s vessel may only benefit from one effect at a time.\n \u2022 Dawn: For three motes, the Solar\u2019s ship becomes an extension of his terrifying might for the rest of the scene \u2014 the minds of his opponents are clouded with fear at the thought of the reprisals that would be invited by assaulting such a vessel. Opponents must pay two points of Willpower to ignore this unnatural Compulsion if they wish to target the ship with their attacks. This power in no way prevents the ship\u2019s crew from being targeted.\n \u2022 Zenith: For three motes, the Solar\u2019s ship becomes Holy ground for the rest of the scene. Any creature of darkness boarding the vessel enters an environmental hazard with Damage (Essence/2)A/action, Trauma (Sail).\n \u2022 Twilight: The ship becomes aware of all threats approaching within (Essence x 30) yards, from above, below, or beside the ship; this warning is communicated to the Solar in the form of eerie sea-sounds which appraise him of the position and bearing of the threat (for example, something below the ship and approaching fast). This benefit costs one mote, and lasts for one day.\n \u2022 Night: For three motes, a mist rises up around the ship\u2019s shrouding it from view. This grants a +3 bonus to all Stealth attempts, and reduces the cost of Sea Ambush Technique by one point of Willpower.\n \u2022 Eclipse: The Solar may pay five motes to cause his anima to surmount the ship as a flag bearing complex sigils which may be understood by all observers. This flag may offer the terms of a truce, alliance, or financial arrangement. It is clear that this offer is genuine, and magically binding; should the captain of another vessel verbally agree to the terms offered by this flag, that fact becomes Obvious to the Solar and he may pay one Willpower to sanctify the oath as though with the Eclipse anima power. Additionally, if the character is a member of the Eclipse caste, he may sanctify any oath spoken aboard his ship that he is aware of for a cost of only one point of Willpower.\n At Sail 6+, Essence 6+ this Charm gains the Stackable Keyword, and the Solar may simultaneously apply up to (Essence - 4) different effects at a time."
