Common examples of this are increasing Defense Values with the Dexterity Excellency, climbing the Feat of Strength chart with the Strength Excellency or increasing alcohol Tolerance with the Stamina Excellency. When enhancing a static value, each success rolled with dice from this Excellency increases the effective relevant Attribute by two for an instant. Thus, one success increases Defense Value by one.\n This Excellency, other Excellencies and other dice-adding Charms cannot \u201ccreate\u201d actions.

A character can have no more than three specialties for a single Attribute. Since a character cannot have Attribute specialties without first buying this Charm, it is possible to lose half a bonus point when purchasing Attribute specialties at character generation.\n Similar to Ability specialties, Attribute specialties add extra dice to specific uses of the Attribute. Because Attributes are broader than Abilities, their specialties should be correspondingly broad. Attribute specialties may be about as restrictive as a normal specialty but cross Abilities, such as \u201cForgeries\u201d or \u201cLong-Term Schemes,\u201d or they can include approximately one Ability, such as \u201cMelee\u201d or \u201cMartial Arts\u201d for Dexterity.\n When channeling this deeper level of instinct, characters limit the amount of their training they can use.

Basic success allows the character to exploit these distortions of the Wyld to travel one mile. Each threshold success allows him to add one zero to the distance or increase the Magnitude of people he leads on the path by one (from a base of zero, himself). Maximum distance is 1,000 miles; maximum Magnitude is (Essence - 1).\n Traveling this way is a dramatic action that requires five minutes. Though the Lunar rarely stays in one place long enough for creatures of the Wyld to accost, taking any nonreflexive actions (to attack something, for example) breaks the character\u2019s concentration and disrupts the Charm. A Lunar who does not complete the trip as planned (i.e., the player fails a roll) usually ends up lost, sometimes far from his intended destination (by 1,000 miles or more distant, in the case of a botch). Assuming nothing goes wrong, the Lunar progresses the appropriate distance toward his destination with the Charm\u2019s conclusion."

A Lunar is considered to be his actual chronological age for the purpose of purchasing Essence dots, rather than his biological age as modified by this Charm. \n A second purchase of this Charm, at Stamina 10+, Essence 9+, allows the character to age in reverse while hibernating in real time. If he hibernates for 10 years, he awakens 10 years physically younger. Using this Charm, a character can reverse-age his body only until it reaches the physical age at which he Exalted. Time spent hibernating in excess of that limit has no further age-reversing effect. This Charm represents the current apex of Lunar anagathic study."

Each Charm defines a category of environmental damage to which the Lunar is immune. The Charms are based upon the five directions:\n \u2022 Center: The character is immune to environmental crippling effects. She takes no damage from avalanches or cave-ins, and being crushed by a ton of rubble is a mere inconvenience. A sandstorm tickles her skin.\n \u2022 East: The character is unaffected by plant-based toxins. Irritating insects avoid her or cannot penetrate her skin, and she never develops annoying rashes. Other creatures that swarm ignore her. Insects that actually damage her subtract three from their dice pools and raw damage values.\n \u2022 North: The character takes no damage from chill or extreme cold. She never catches a chill. Terrible ice storms provide a pleasant massage. She never feels uncomfortably cold, only pleasantly cool.\n \u2022 South: The character may walk through natural and magical flames without pain. Fire does not burn her clothing. Extreme heat does not harm her. She never feels uncomfortably hot, only pleasantly warm. In sandstorms, particles do not even get stuck in her clothing.\n \u2022 West: The character is comfortable and can breathe at all depths. Venoms of marine life do not affect her, and she takes no damage from schools of small, dangerous fish or other masses of underwater creatures. These Charms are meant to be complete, protecting the character from all environmental dangers inherent to a given direction. Specific environmental threats not mentioned should fall under one of the five Charms.\n Some (such as sandstorms) may fall under more than one. When another character deliberately causes or uses environmental effects with intent to harm the Lunar, she is not immune."

She may slaughter her foes as dispassionately as the most cold-blooded assassin, show her rage with shouts and grimaces, or act any other way she desires. This short-lived Charm is the exemplar of Lunar\u2014indeed, some say Exalted\u2014combat. Shielded by their fury, the character becomes a truly frightening foe.\n The Charm\u2019s initial benefits are modest. The character adds one automatic success to all combat actions, from attacking and resisting knockdown to keeping balance during the fight, but her Defense Values remain unaffected. She does not suffer wound penalties until they are worse than -1 and completely ignores fatigue for the duration. Finally, the maximum benefit the character may obtain from her physical Attribute Excellencies increases to (Attribute + Essence). Relentless Lunar Fury\u2019s real power lies in other Charms. Certain Charms have the Fury-OK keyword. These Charms describe special (but related) effects that they have when activated simultaneously with the Relentless Lunar Fury. Any Fury Charm\u2019s special benefit may be activated as a part of Relentless Lunar Fury without a Combo by adding two motes to the cost of Relentless Lunar Fury. These Charms\u2019 fury effects always end with Relentless Lunar Fury. Characters may have the normal version of a Charm active at the same time the Fury-OK version of a Charm is active. A character may not activate more than (Essence) additional fury Charms at once.\n Example: The Count\u2019s wax soldiers surround Kajeha Lef, a Dexterity 4, Essence 3 Lunar. Activating Relentless Lunar Fury as a preface to tearing them apart, Lef also activates the fury effects of Painless Warrior Meditation and Wasp Sting Blur, bringing the total cost of Relentless Lunar Fury up to five motes and one Willpower. She could add one more fury effect (since she has Essence 3) but not more than that until she gains Essence 4. Normally, Kajeha Lef\u2019s player may use Dexterity Excellencies to purchase four dice or two successes. While channeling her character\u2019s rage, her player may purchase up to seven dice or three successes.\n A Lunar\u2019s fury comes with one drawback: The Lunar becomes so very focused that she cannot perform non-combat actions. The Lunar must continue to hunt and kill enemies until the Charm ends. With a successful Reflexive Willpower roll, the character can perform a non-combat action (at -2 dice) or come off the offensive for a single action. She can only stop the fury early by forcefully calming her anger and cooling her blood; to do so, her player rolls (Willpower) at a difficulty of the character\u2019s Valor.\n When a character activates more than three additional Charms in tandem with Relentless Lunar Fury (which requires Essence 4 or higher), the Charm becomes Obvious. Silver and white light flows around the character\u2019s weapon and forms contrails to emphasize her prowess."

This Charm is a single attack, either a natural attack or a launch from the character\u2019s mouth. The latter attack uses (Dexterity + [Athletics or Thrown]) at a -2 accuracy, with range 5.\n The character may also invent his own supernatural acids, each of requires four experience points or two bonus points to purchase. Samples follow. The Lunar receives one listed acid gratis when the Charm is purchased.\n Burning Tar: This acid is gummy, sickly green and sticky. It inflicts eight lethal damage when first inflicted on a target and the same on each of the target\u2019s subsequent actions until someone removes the acid. Scraping off the acid is a miscellaneous action (-1 Defense Value) that does not require a roll.\n Foe-Softening Discharge: Clear and sharp-smelling, this secretion does not inflict damage. When this acid strikes a foe, the Lunar\u2019s player chooses one of his target\u2019s Physical Attributes, Appearance or Perception and rolls (Stamina + Essence) at a difficulty equal to the target Attribute. Success on the roll reduces that Attribute by one dot. Exalted heal this damage at one dot per week, but the damage is usually permanent for mortals.\n Soporific Nectar: This white fluid gives off a powerful aroma that can set most creatures reeling. As long as the Nectar connects with its target, the Lunar\u2019s player rolls (Stamina + [Medicine or Survival]) at a difficulty of the target\u2019s Stamina. Success fills all the target\u2019s remaining health levels with bashing damage down to the -4 box; only Incapacitated remains empty.\n Steel-Eater: This dull gray, watery acid inflicts only three lethal damage against creatures and quickly loses its potency. When used to target steel objects, such as many weapons or armors, this acid inflicts 10 lethal damage and ignores Hardness. Characters do not soak this. Instead, their weapons or armor soak with their own damage or soak ratings, respectively. Each die of damage left afterward automatically reduces the target object\u2019s damage or soak (or health levels, for items neither weapons nor armor) by one. Weapons reduced to +0 damage and armor reduced to no soak are considered destroyed. Some weapons or armors, especially family heirlooms, may be reparable at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion."

This Charm only requires a brief touch (during which its effects are Obvious to the Solar being targeted, but not to any observers), although in the First Age it was common for it to be incorporated into formal oaths of fealty, pledges of brotherhood, or marriage vows. For each mote the Lunar commits to the Charm, she establishes one dot of Solar Bond with the Solar she is touching. This Charm may only be used to maintain a bond with one Solar at a time, and in no way obviates the Lunar\u2019s existing bond; indeed, if the subject of her original bond is present in the scene, the force of that original bond rises up and mutes out Silver and Gold Span the Heavens, rendering the Charm ineffective until the Lunar\u2019s original mate is no longer present.\n The bond established by this Charm is mechanically considered a true Solar-Lunar bond in all ways (including the creation of an unbreakable positive Intimacy), save for the Knack Golden Widow Method (see Glories of the Most High: Luna, p. 35).\u00a0The Lunar must pay one Willpower to voluntarily end this Charm; doing so does not erase the Intimacy created by her temporary bond, but the Intimacy may now be eroded normally.\n This Charm's bond pool is self-contained; that is to say, it refreshes at the end of the story. For example, Lilith uses the Charm to create a three point bond to Dace, and then channels all three dice. The next day she cancels Silver and Gold Span the Heavens and creates a five-point bond to Panther. Because she already spent three of her bond dice from this Charm, she only has two left to use to assist Panther. After spending them, she cancels the Charm and bonds herself to Arianna, committing five motes. Now she has no dice left to spend to help Arianna until the beginning of the next story, when her Solar Bond dice pool refreshes. Lilith also has Solar Bond 3 toward Swan, her original mate; she still has three bond dice to channel to assist him, as that pool is separate from the one created by Silver and Gold Span the Heavens.\n If used to target an Abyssal or Infernal Exalt, this Charm\u2019s cost gains a one Willpower surcharge."

Any targets of this Charm whose Mental Defense Values are less than the number of successes on the roll maintain this belief for the rest of the scene. Shaking off this unnatural mental influence costs two points of Willpower. The Lunar\u2019s player selects the belief to invert.\n When using this Charm on many targets at once, it does not affect anyone who does not hold the targeted belief in the first place.

Weaving a scene with his words, gestures and convenient props, the character introduces his target to one of the many insanities found in the Wyld. With the end of the speech, the character inflicts that insanity upon the target. The player rolls (Manipulation + Presence) in a social attack that cannot be parried.

At Essence 5, the inflicted derangement can have the strength of a deformity.\n Targets of Lost Mirror Flight must spend one point of Willpower to ignore the effects of the madness for a single scene. After subduing the insanity a number of times equal to (Lunar\u2019s Essence x 2), the effect ends.\n By adding a point of Willpower to the Charm\u2019s cost, the Lunar may instead make a (Manipulation + Performance) roll, affecting a group with a Magnitude no greater than his (Essence - 1). Against groups, only lesser insanities apply (the strength of a deficiency).\n Storytellers can use the Wyld derangements found in Exalted (see pp. 288-289), The Compass of Celestial Directions: The Wyld, or this book, pages 209-210, as guidelines for this Charm. They do not derive from Wyld energy, so Charms such as Order-Affirming Blow cannot right them."

The player makes a (Perception + Investigation) roll to detect the scents or Essence residue left behind by everyone who has passed through an area recently. The number of successes on the roll dictates how far back the character detects. One success provides traces from the last 24 hours, and each additional success doubles that number. The vast catalog of information available on a roll with many successes does not overwhelm the Lunar, and the character knows how recently (or within which time-category) each scent visited. These scents lack connection to names or faces unless the Lunar is already familiar with a person. Otherwise, the player receives a Reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll to notice the scent of a person identified by this Charm when that person comes nearby. The player makes no more than one such roll per person in a single scene.\n Characters may target weapons, concubines or other tools to lift the scents of people who have touched them."

Some examples follow:\n Difficulty 1\u2014\u201cWill my chosen culture flourish?\u201d \u201cDo the Arczeckhi attack Nexus before I can gather my pack?\u201d\n Difficulty 3\u2014\u201cWhere do I find the secret to the Empress\u2019 defeat?\u201d \u201cDoes civil war break out in the current Realm before the 15th day of Ascending Wood of next year?\u201d\n Difficulty 5+\u2014\u201cHow can I recover the lost Lunar Castes?\u201d \u201cWhere am I in exactly 236 days?\u201d\n Results play out in a scene that the Lunar observes or experiences. Straightforward answers usually receive straightforward answers: an image of the culture flourishing or the city untouched by war is enough to communicate clearly. Questions that are more difficult reveal scenes that are more complicated, which the character must interact with to find his answer. Some questions have no \u201csimple\u201d solutions, and the scenes they reveal may be improbable, incomprehensible or far from immediately clear or useful.\n This Charm has some consequences. Failing to meet the difficulty by two successes or more produces a flawed scene that the character does not realize is incorrect. Botching the roll gives the character a vision of whatever answer he most fears."

This Charm uses the connection between Wyld and Creation inherent in every Lunar to make the target, one creature or object of any size, natural to and safe within Creation. To work this Charm, the Lunar must alter a target object in some way, such as drawing her personal symbol upon it; a living creature must hold or wear something the Lunar made with her own hands.\n Portable objects affected by this Charm may be brought out of the Wyld without fear that they will evaporate into figment, while living things may leave the Chaos and live out their days in Creation without degenerating under the weight of its stasis. Objects too large to move do not fade quickly in the Wyld, though they become susceptible to its mutative energies just like any structure built out of Creation-based materials. Lunars sometimes use this Charm to stabilize buildings, caves or other small places created by the Wyld to use them for bases of operation. A Lunar may also want to preserve some oddity of the Wyld for study. Used at the edge of Creation, Lunars can slowly push back the Wyld\u2019s boundaries a little patch of ground at a time. Using this Charm on objects too large to be moved costs 20 motes; all other uses cost 10 motes.\n Things maintained by this Charm do not have their own reality. They share the Steward\u2019s reality and that of Luna and Gaia. Unless someone in Heaven undertakes to connect the person or object to the Loom of Fate, the object remains only partially real. If an object tied to Creation by this Charm does not interact meaningfully with things naturally of Creation during a story, roll the Lunar\u2019s Essence at difficulty 1, difficulty 2 if it does not interact with real things at all. Three cumulative failures on this roll indicate that the object\u2019s reality is lost, and it fades away.\n Creatures who were once part of Creation but are now too mutated to survive within it suffer a level of unsoakable bashing damage when the Essence roll fails. This damage cannot heal naturally unless the creature recuperates in the Wyld. After six cumulative failures on the roll, Creation becomes inhospitable to the creature as normal, generally forcing it to return to the Wyld."

The Charm fails if anyone interrupts the Lunar before its completion.\n Once the character has invoked the Charm, the Wyld energies in the region become quiescent. While the local abnormal physical (and metaphysical) laws remain the same, they do not change as long as the Charm remains effective.\n This Charm cannot affect territory owned (see Exalted, p. 283) by another Essence user, which are more common in the Wyld than in Creation. While the Charm is active, Fair Folk (and other Wyld denizens) with Essence less than the Lunar\u2019s cannot affect the region with shaping actions or effects.\n A Lunar cannot always stay to protect the territory she claims in the Wyld. By sacrificing one dot of permanent Willpower (which the character may regain through experience points), the character no longer needs to spend further Willpower to maintain the Ritual of Lunar Stability and can give the Charm its monthly 10 motes no matter where she is. The perpetuated Charm is tied to a small object of the Lunar\u2019s choice; destroying the object instantly destroys the Charm. Lunars use this Charm to solidify their personal redoubts or make their lands safer against the Wyld.

(It is most useful to buy this benefit after a successful sacred hunt.) When in that form thereafter, he can activate this Charm to call upon those memories for another hour.

Upon awakening from such a nightmare, the character rolls Conviction as normal. Success indicates that the character simply gains no Willpower. Failure leaves the character disoriented throughout the remainder of the day, suffering a -1 internal penalty to all actions as vague recollections of awful sights and the cold, merciless light of the moon prey on her thoughts.

Being in Wyld areas, or in areas where foreign animals have been imported, can levy a one- to four-die penalty to the roll."

The two are, in fact, the same Charm, and so a purchase of Silver Lunar Resolution in Wits counts against the total maximum number of purchases for the Charm in any Attribute. Silver Lunar Resolution is also available in Charisma."
