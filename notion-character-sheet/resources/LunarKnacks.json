If the Lunar cannot hunt a natural animal that is larger than the Last Supplicant or smaller than the head of a pin, it is not because he lacks the ability\u2014it is because the animal does not exist.\n A character without Emerald Grasshopper Form is limited to infinitely larger forms and one without Tow\u00adering Beast Form is limited to infinitely smaller forms.

She develops an instinctive understanding of the different sacred hunt necessary to make humans valid targets of the hunt. Taking on a false human shape costs a point of Willpower.\n The base time of the hunt is half a day, during which time the character studies the person\u2019s habits and nature, absorbing them the same way she will steal the person\u2019s body. Some Lunars watch their victims covertly during the process; others hunt the target viciously, tormenting him and studying his reactions until the final blow. The latter method is faster but more difficult to perform in high-population areas. Either way, it\u2019s murder (unless the Lunar has Life of the Hummingbird and merely takes a person\u2019s shape temporarily). Taking a human\u2019s Heart\u2019s Blood triggers a Compassion roll in any character with Compassion 3 or greater, and each success adds one point of Limit to the Lunar\u2019s total, no matter what his dominant Virtue may be.\n Lunars pursue human forms for many reasons: Having even a single human false form is useful when one\u2019s true form becomes dangerous and an animal shape is inappropriate. Some human forms are useful for their identities\u2014becoming Great Forks\u2019 Minister of Lore is a significant advantage.\n Finally, different human forms may have access to different resources. Stealing a wealthy merchant\u2019s form gives the character a lot of money to throw around, and becoming a friendly socialite comes with a host of contacts and allies. Lunar Exalted may benefit from these stolen Backgrounds temporarily, but they require effort to maintain\u2014otherwise, the investments dry up, and friends forget about the person who is no longer often around.\n Exalted and other human creatures may have Charms and other powers of their own. Taking on one\u2019s form through the sacred hunt does not give the Lunar access to any of their Essence-based powers. Taking a Lunar\u2019s form in this way provides only the Lunar\u2019s human true form, not the spirit shape or any other form the victim might know.

The character can instead master a shape forever by spending a point of experience per shape.\n This Knack also gives the Lunar a rarely used ritual that targets another Lunar as the subject of the sacred hunt. In this case, the character must hunt down and fight the target Lunar. After killing the target, the Lunar drinks the target\u2019s heart\u2019s blood and gains every shape the other Lunar has mastered and the target\u2019s human and animal true forms (though they do not become new true forms). \n The war form is too unique to each Lunar\u2019s Essence to be duplicated in this way. (Note that cannibalizing a selection of heart\u2019s blood forms increases the character\u2019s Heart\u2019s Blood Background. Some Storytellers may rule that this costs experience points\u2014see pp. 232-233.)"

The Lu\u00adnar must have within her heart\u2019s blood library the form of a spirit corresponding to the feature she wishes to become\u2014a river god, for example, if she wishes to become a river. The Lu\u00adnar is only semi-mobile in this form, moving at most ten miles per day, and unable to directly act upon anything venturing within her boundaries, though she may observe the interior of her being from any point as though she were present, and adds three dice to all Perception rolls to notice intruders within her. While not immune to damage in landscape form, per se, the Lunar is formidably protected\u2014destroying a Lunar wear\u00ading the form of a mountain, for example, would likely require Solar Circle sorcery or powerful artifacts of mass destruction. \n The Lunar may not destroy any existing landscape fea\u00adtures by using this Knack; existing geography instead recon\u00adfigures itself to account for the new inclusion. For example, if the Lunar were to become a river winding its way through the middle of Whitewall, the city\u2019s streets and roads would temporarily route themselves around it, span the Lunar with bridges, and so forth. A Lunar who became a forest in Nexus would briefly transform Nexus into a thriving trade city lo\u00adcated in the heart of a forest. The Lunar also may not assume a geographic form in a place where it is impossible for that feature to exist (clouds, for example, are rarely found under\u00adwater, and mountains and rivers generally do not float two hundred feet above the ground), unless she is in the Wyld. Finally, the Lunar\u2019s Tell extends to blanket her in a veil of normalcy; observers must pierce the Tell in order to realize there is anything unusual about a mountain suddenly spring\u00ading up overnight."

He must allocate a number of dots of permanent Essence into the double. Those dots are then removed from the main Lunar and are considered to be the double\u2019s permanent Essence rating. Creating a double requires the allocation of at least two dots of Essence, and the original Steward may not reduce himself below Essence 2. The character is free to invoke this Knack to create as many doubles as his Essence dots may be spread between. \n Doubles are semi-independent extensions of the Lunar\u2019s will. They share his personality, goals, traits (up to any limits imposed by their lower Essence ratings) and essentially operate as remote extensions of his mind. They do not consider themselves to be independent entities. Doubles cannot move more than a mile from the original Lunar, and will automatically denature into Essence if forcibly carried beyond that limit. They are able to use any Lunar Charms or Knacks the character knows and which their Essence rating allows. These Charms draw out of the original Lunar\u2019s Essence and Willpower pools, although doubles have independent health tracks. (Any damage required by Charm activation comes from the double\u2019s own health track.) A double\u2019s Charm selections are independent of the original Lunar\u2019s. A Lunar and his double may each use a different Charm at the same time without need of a Combo. \n In order to absorb the memories of anything learned by a double, or to enjoy any Heart\u2019s Blood additions gained by a double, the Lunar must touch the copy and spend a miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV -0) re-absorbing it. Doing so also restores the Essence dots lent out to create it.\n If a double is slain, the Lunar regenerates the lost Essence dots at a rate of one per week."

        "description": "This Knack forms the basis of many Lunar battle techniques. Once a character learns it, she can shift into the fearsome war form of the Lunar Exalted, a monstrous amalgam of her two other true forms. The Steward usually gains several feet in height and increases proportionally in mass. Muscles ripple across her form, which usually has fearsomely long and sharp teeth and/or claws. Even if the Lunar\u2019s spirit shape is something as harmless as a groundhog, the hybrid war form looks awesomely dangerous. War forms are stronger, faster and more resilient than the character\u2019s normal forms. They have animal characteristics that give them an edge. Lunars in war form heal even faster than other Exalted, and war form allows them to make use of special aspects of certain Charms, called Gifts. Because Dexterity, animal qualities, healing and Gifts can all be useful outside of combat, some Lunars use war forms for purposes other than combat. At the very least, the war form is a tool of purpose\u2014the Lunar dons this form to accomplish a goal. Design the war form as follows:\n \u2022 Bonus Attributes. When a character takes Deadly Beastman Transformation, her player adds one dot each to the character\u2019s Strength, Dexterity and Stamina. This increase can bring a character\u2019s physical Attributes above five and only affect the character when she is in war form. Any improved Attributes are considered natural when calculating the Lunar\u2019s dice maximums. (See the box on p. 128 for a description of natural Attributes.)\n \u2022 Wyld Mutations. The character\u2019s player adds mutations to the form to represent animalistic features. She chooses from the list of Wyld mutations in Exalted, pages 288-290, or creates her own, then applies these to the war form. The player has (Essence + 4) special bonus points to spend on mutations, using the costs given on page 101. Increases in Essence later on allow the player to choose further mutations or \u201cupgrade\u201d existing mutations.\n Ignore all negative aspects to these mutations beyond the obvious and frightening change in appearance. These are not actually Wyld mutations; they represent the admixture of human and animal of the hybrid form. Players can only choose or create mutations appropriate to the characters\u2019 spirit shapes. Characters cannot take negative mutations, such as deficiencies, and they cannot take single mutations multiple times. Players cannot apply the Large mutation to the war form; war forms are already larger and stronger than a normal human form. Players may, however, apply the Small mutation, accepting its benefits and penalties. This is how some Lunars create their smaller, less monstrous-seeming war forms. Players and Storytellers must remember that not all mutations are appropriate as animal Traits. Those that are not may be altered, at the Storyteller\u2019s discretion, to represent an appropriate animal Trait.\n Some mutations alter the character\u2019s health level track. Ignore these changes; Lunar Exalted remain hard to wound even when their war form is slight and fast, and the increased resilience of the Exalted is represented by their Ox-Body Technique.\n While in the war form, Lunars also gain a supernatural resilience that helps them survive terrible wounds. The Lunar does not actually heal any faster (that requires Charms such Bruise-Relief Method and Healing the Scarlet Flow). While in war form, however, a Lunar can completely regrow lost limbs or organs using such Charms. It takes at an hour to regenerate such an extreme wound.\n When a Lunar in war form falls into her Dying health levels, her wounds do not worsen. She does not lose additional levels of damage until she dies; instead, she remains that wounded until either someone stabilizes her with surgery (returning her to Incapacitated) or she uses a Charm to heal a point of lethal damage, which accomplishes the same effect. (For this reason, the Lunars\u2019 Ox-Body Technique gives them two additional Dying health levels with each purchase.)\n Taking Deadly Beastman Transformation also allows the character to make better use of Gift Charms. Legend says that Luna herself composed Gift Charms for her Exalted. When a character learns a Charm with the Gift keyword, she gains abilities that she can activate automatically when she dons her war form. See the individual Charms for more details."
